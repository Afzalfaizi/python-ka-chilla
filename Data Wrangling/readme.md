# Data Wrangling

Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing data in a way that makes it more suitable for analysis. It is a crucial step in the data science process as real-world data is often messy and inconsistent.

 

* The general steps to do Data Wrnagling in python are as follows:

Steps to perform data wrangling on the Titanic dataset in Python using pandas library: The steps of data wrangling in Python typically include:

* Importing necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib 
* Loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame
* Assessing the data for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
* Cleaning the data by filling in missing values, removing outliers, and correcting errors
* Organizing the data by creating new columns, renaming columns, sorting, and filtering the data
* Storing the cleaned data in a format that can be used for future analysis, such as a CSV or Excel file
* Exploring the data by creating  visualizations and using descriptive  statistics
* Creating a pivot table to summarize the data
* Checking for and handling duplicate rows
* Encoding categorical variables
* Removing unnecessary columns or rows
* Merging or joining multiple datasets
* Handling missing or null values
* Reshaping the data
* Formatting the data
* Normalizing or scaling the data
* Creating new features from existing data
* Validating data integrity
* Saving the final data for future use

## Please note that the steps may vary depending on the data, the requirements, and the goals of the analysis. Itâ€™s worth noting that these are general steps and the specific steps you take will depend on the dataset you are working with and the analysis you plan to perform.
